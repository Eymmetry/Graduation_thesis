abstract = {Magnetohydrodynamic generation is the conversion of fluid kinetic energy into electricity. Such conversion, which has been applied to various types of electric power generation, is driven by the Lorentz force acting on charged particles and thus a magnetic field is necessary. On the other hand, recent studies of spintronics have revealed the similarity between the function of a magnetic field and that of spin-orbit interactions in condensed matter. This suggests the existence of an undiscovered route to realize the conversion of fluid dynamics into electricity without using magnetic fields. Here we show electric voltage generation from fluid dynamics free from magnetic fields; we excited liquid-metal flows in a narrow channel and observed longitudinal voltage generation in the liquid. This voltage has nothing to do with electrification or thermoelectric effects, but turned out to follow a universal scaling rule based on a spin-mediated scenario. The result shows that the observed voltage is caused by spin-current generation from a fluid motion: spin hydrodynamic generation. The observed phenomenon allows us to make mechanical spin-current and electric generators, opening a door to fluid spintronics.},

abstract = {The effects of Pt/Ta seed layer on the thermal stability of perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) compared to a single Ta seed layer was investigated in detail. The results showed that the PMA property is still stable in Pt/Ta/CoFeB/MgO sample above 300 °C annealing temperature. However, it deteriorates in Ta single seed layer when the annealing temperature increase up to 270 °C. Through microstructure analysis, the reason was attributed to the different elements diffusion tendency in the whole structure. It was found that the crystallization of seed layer Pt supplies an efficient diffusion paths for Ta. It decreases the ratio of Ta (about 15%) at CoFeB/MgO interface, and ensure more Fe-O bonding to improve PMA and its temperature stability. However, the Ta single seed layer is amorphous. It may diffuse to the CoFeB easily and decrease the hybridization between Fe/Co 3d and O 2p orbits. These observations confirm that the Pt/Ta seed layer provides a promising avenue to enhance the thermal stability of PMA effect, and meets the requirement of field-free spin-orbit torque (SOT) switching based on their opposite spin Hall angels.}

abstract = {The inverse spin-Hall effect (ISHE) induced by the spin pumping has been investigated systematically in simple ferromagnetic/paramagnetic bilayer systems.

In a

The spectral shape of the electromotive force is well reproduced using a simple Lorentz function, indicating that the electromotive force is due to the ISHE induced by the spin pumping; extrinsic magnetogalvanic effects are eliminated in this measurement. The electromotive force varies systematically by changing the microwave power, magnetic-field angle, and film size, being consistent with the prediction based on the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation combined with the models of the ISHE and spin pumping. The electromotive force was observed also in a

abstract = {Finding a means to generate, control and use spin-polarized currents represents an important challenge for spin-based electronics, or 'spintronics'. Spin currents and the associated phenomenon of spin accumulation can be realized by driving a current from a ferromagnetic electrode into a non-magnetic metal or semiconductor. This was first demonstrated over 15 years ago in a spin injection experiment on a single crystal aluminium bar at temperatures below 77 K. Recent experiments have demonstrated successful optical detection of spin injection in semiconductors, using either optical injection by circularly polarized light or electrical injection from a magnetic semiconductor. However, it has not been possible to achieve fully electrical spin injection and detection at room temperature. Here we report room-temperature electrical injection and detection of spin currents and observe spin accumulation in an all-metal lateral mesoscopic spin valve, where ferromagnetic electrodes are used to drive a spin-polarized current into crossed copper strips. We anticipate that larger signals should be obtainable by optimizing the choice of materials and device geometry.},

abstract = {The generation of electric voltage by placing a conductor in a temperature gradient is called the Seebeck effect. Its efficiency is represented by the Seebeck coefficient, S, which is defined as the ratio of the generated electric voltage to the temperature difference, and is determined by the scattering rate and the density of the conduction electrons. The effect can be exploited, for example, in thermal electric-power generators and for temperature sensing, by connecting two conductors with different Seebeck coefficients, a device called a thermocouple. Here we report the observation of the thermal generation of driving power, or voltage, for electron spin: the spin Seebeck effect. Using a recently developed spin-detection technique that involves the spin Hall effect, we measure the spin voltage generated from a temperature gradient in a metallic magnet. This thermally induced spin voltage persists even at distances far from the sample ends, and spins can be extracted from every position on the magnet simply by attaching a metal. The spin Seebeck effect observed here is directly applicable to the production of spin-voltage generators, which are crucial for driving spintronic devices. The spin Seebeck effect allows us to pass a pure spin current, a flow of electron spins without electric currents, over a long distance. These innovative capabilities will invigorate spintronics research.},

By measuring the charge current arising from the IREE at different temperatures, we found that the spin-charge conversion efficiency is almost independent of temperature.
